What does metaverse mean for businesses?
The definition of a metaverse is “a persistent, shared, 3D virtual space linked into a perceived virtual universe.” ... Businesses that want to stay competitive should make plans for how they are going to engage with customers, find new advertising opportunities, and bring in sponsorships in the metaverse


	A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.[1][2][3] In futurism and science fiction, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.[4][5]

The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." Various metaverses have been developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life.[6] Some metaverse iterations involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies,[5] often including a significant interest in advancing virtual reality technology.[7][8][9]

The term has seen considerable use as a buzzword[4][10] for public relations purposes to exaggerate development progress for various related technologies and projects.
