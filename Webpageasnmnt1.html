		<strong><h1>Metaverse</h1></strong>
		<img src="vr.jpg">

	<p> Metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.[1][2][3] In futurism and science fiction, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.[4][5]

The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." Various metaverses have been developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life.[6] Some metaverse iterations involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies,[5] often including a significant interest in advancing virtual reality technology.[7][8][9]

The term has seen considerable use as a buzzword[4][10] for public relations purposes to exaggerate development progress for various related technologies and projects.
